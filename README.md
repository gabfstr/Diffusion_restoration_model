# Extending DDRM Diffusion Restoration model 
Proposing a first step towards **blind-image** deblurring (unkown blur kernel) and **non-uniform** deblurring and discussing video deblurring.

Read the report : [Project Report](https://github.com/gabfstr/Diffusion_restoration_model/blob/main/DDRM_Extension_Project.pdf)

We wish to explore DDRM's limitations and bridge the gap towards solving them : we propose a first model allowing DDRM to perform deblurring with **Unkown degradation**, and a first step towards addressing **Non linear inverse problems** (Non uniform, real life blur) **with unkown kernel**. We also discuss extension to video deblurring and how to make use of the temporal dimension.

This project was part of the MVA course on Generative models for images. Materials from the course can be found [here](https://vdeborto.github.io/project/generative_modeling/)
